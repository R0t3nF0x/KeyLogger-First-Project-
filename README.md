# KeyLogger-First-Project-
This is my first project as I begin my journey to becoming a Malware Analyst and Reverse Engineer. It was created purely for educational purposes.
I spent around 3–4 hours building it after completing a C programming fundamentals course just last week. Since it's my very first project, I chose not to hide the terminal window — it helps me troubleshoot if something goes wrong.
